Since this is my first ever coding project I decided using a fictional character rather than a real one.

    <p>Created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld, Deadpool made his first appeareance in the comic book <em>The New Mutants #98</em> (1991) as a supervillain, later evolving to the antihero <s>we all</s> some people know today</s>.</p>
    <p><s>Born</s> Named Wade Wilson, his inability to ever shut up allied with an unlimited repertoire of morally ambiguous jokes and obscenities has earned him the earned him the title "The Merc With A Mouth".</p>
    <p>Deadpool's main superpower is an accelerated healing factor that allows him to survive even decapitation, but also makes him <s>shitbat crazy</s> mentally unstable. This mental condition also makes him a highly unpredictable opponent and an expert at distracting and enraging his enemies through his wisecracks. Also a highly trained assassin, proficient in many forms of combat and in the use of multiple weapons, Deadpool also has the ability to make everyone else <s>dislike</s> hate him.</p>
    <p>Deadpool is also the only comic book character which actually knows he's a comic book character. He's able to engage with the readers or audience and even read other comic books in order to gain knowledge about other characters. He is also aware that there is a Wikipedia page about him and probably even this project.
